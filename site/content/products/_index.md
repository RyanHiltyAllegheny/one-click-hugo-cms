heading: Where Did it Start?
description: >-
  I grew up in a small town outside of Pittsburgh, PA. I attended Penn-Trafford Highschool where I graduated in 2018 with a high academic and athletic ambition. Son of a loving father and mother, with one younger sister, and cannot forget about the fifth family member, Murphy. Before I figured out what all life was about, I liked to be outside playing sports or fishing on the side of the pond. I spent much of my time dedicated to school, family, and friends. Without them I wouldn't be anywhere!

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
