heading: Where Did it Start?
description: >-
  I grew up in a small town outside of Pittsburgh, PA. I attended Penn-Trafford Highschool where I graduated in 2018 with a high academic and athletic ambition. Son of a loving father and mother, with one younger sister, and cannot forget about the fifth family member, Murphy. Before I figured out what all life was about, I liked to be outside playing sports or fishing on the side of the pond. I spent much of my time dedicated to school, family, and friends. Without them I wouldn't be anywhere!
